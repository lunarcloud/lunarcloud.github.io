            <h2 class="nag-target">About Sam Sarette</h2>

            <p>He's a community-minded storytelling maker. He's a professional developer. He's a leader.</p>
            <p>Sam has always been a creative guy, creating fictional worlds and roping his friends into creating characters and stories has been a lifelong past-time.</p>
            <p>At the same time, he's been tinkering with robotics since his early lego mindstorm childhood and learning programming at summer-camp.</p>

            <h3><span class="icon">‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è</span>Medical Lab Devices</h3>

            <p>
                Sam has proudly created software for several robotics-powered devices at KMC Systems, Inc since
                before graduating Keene State College.
            </p>
            <p>
                He's been able to leaverage his hobbyist work in VR to create virtual lab environments,
                and his web expertise from his steampunk community works to improve the web frontends of instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
                He has lots of fun moving motors and reading sensors, and is proud of the many processes and
                tooling he's helped establish to make the act of creating professional, documented work easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam is currently a principle engineer leading a small team to recreate a project from early in his career.
                This effort is going well, and he would say he's very proud of it so far.
            </p>

            <h3>Leading in Communities</h3>

            <h4><span class="icon">üöÇ</span>Steampunk</h4>
            <p>
                He and his group "the Citizens of Antiford" have been leaders in the Steampunk community,
                and have been involved in teaching new community members with their "Intro to Steampunk" presentation.
                This steampunk group has been involved in the planning of at least 2 festivals,
                notably the "Railway to the Moon" planning, and helped shape the steampunk track of RuffleCon.
            </p>
            <p>
                His proudest accomplishments include creating and managing a social media writing platform,
                helping realize the group's crowd-funded anthology, and running a small festival of their own.
                Sam is proud of the focus on history and crafting that the community embraces and that he's embraced back.
            </p>
            <p>
                This steampunk community is inactive since the pandemic.
                A decade-long project is resting while it's members discover more in life, as does Sam.
            </p>

            <h4><span class="icon">üéÆ</span>Hobbyist Game Development</h4>
            <p>
                Sam's steampunk connections and long history of interest with game development, led him to be
                introduced to a professor of game development at NHTI (AGGP program no longer offered).
                He attended his first game jam as part of a partnership between his steampunk group and school.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam became an avid member of the Southern NH Game Developer Meetup and the Independent Game Developer's Association NH.
                When the organizer of the SNHGD Meetup was looking to be less involved, Sam stepped up to help plan the monthly meetups.
                He led the transition to digital meetups during the pandemic and a hybrid (every-other) schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam tends to lead meetings as a casual "scrum-like" affair, followed by demos and discussion.
                He and his fellow organizers are planning more activities in future for this group.
            </p>
