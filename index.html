            <h2 class="nag-target">About Sam Sarette</h2>

            <p>He’s a community-minded storytelling maker. He’s a professional developer. He’s a leader.</p>
            <p>Sam has always been a creative guy, creating fictional worlds and roping his friends into creating characters and stories has been a lifelong past-time.</p>
            <p>At the same time, He’s been tinkering with robotics since his early lego mindstorm childhood and learning programming at summer-camp.</p>

            <h3><span class="icon">‍⚕️</span>Medical Lab Devices</h3>

            <p>
                Sam has proudly created software for several robotics-powered devices at HiArc,
                formerly KMC Systems, since before graduating Keene State College.
            </p>
            <p>
                He’s been able to leverage his hobbyist work in VR to create virtual lab environments,
                and his web expertise from his steampunk community works to improve the web frontends of instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
                He has lots of fun moving motors and reading sensors, and is proud of the many processes and
                tooling He’s helped establish to make the act of creating professional, documented work easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam has been positioned into a technical leadership role, leading larger and larger teams, as his social skills
                and technical knowledge have created a helpful mixture for enabling software teams and navigating work politics.
            </p>

            <h3>Leading in Communities</h3>

            <h4><span class="icon">🚂</span>Steampunk</h4>
            <p>
                He and his group “the Citizens of Antiford” have been leaders in the Steampunk community,
                and have been involved in teaching new community members with their “Intro to Steampunk” presentation.
                This steampunk group has been involved in the planning of at least 2 festivals,
                notably the “Railway to the Moon” planning, and helped shape the steampunk track of RuffleCon.
            </p>
            <p>
                His proudest accomplishments include creating and managing a social media writing platform,
                helping realize the group’s crowd-funded anthology, and running a small festival of their own.
                Sam is proud of the focus on history and crafting that the community embraces and that He’s embraced back.
            </p>
            <p>
                This steampunk community is inactive since the pandemic.
                A decade-long project is resting while it’s members discover more in life, as does Sam.
            </p>

            <h4><span class="icon">🎮</span>Game Development</h4>
            <p>
                Sam has created hobbyist games since childhood, participated in many game jams, contributed to both open-source and professional game technology-powered projects over the years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam’s steampunk connections and long history of interest in game development, led him to be introduced to the professor who managed the game development "AGGP" program at NHTI (no longer offered).
                He attended his first game jam as part of a partnership between his steampunk group and school.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam participated in the Boston VR Meetup group in 2015, and then switched to being an avid member of both the Independent Game Developer’s Association NH —until it's final meeting in 2019— and the Southern NH Game Developer Meetup.
                When the organizer of the SNHGD Meetup was looking to be less involved, Sam stepped up to help plan the monthly meetups.
            </p>
            <p>
                He led the transition to digital meetups during the pandemic and a hybrid (every-other) schedule.
                Sam tends to lead meetings as a casual “scrum-like” affair, followed by demos and discussion.
                He and his fellow organizers are planning more activities in future for this group.
            </p>
